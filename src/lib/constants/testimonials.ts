      "I thoroughly enjoyed connecting with Angel. We ended up talking at great length with her passing on some guidance from loved ones in spirit, who stepped forward with some uplifting messages. Linking in with her cards, she put a query of mine over a person of interest into some perspective. I felt encouraged and enlightened after such a positive reading and I would highly recommend this psychic for a very detailed reading. Many Blessings from the lady by the coast xx.",

      "Hi Jasmine, thank you so much for the very honest reading you gave me, no point in sugar coating events. It was nice to feel that I had someone on my side guiding me to make the right decisions. What you advised made a lot of sense and I’ve put what we discussed into practice. I’ve had readings off you before and on each occasion, I have come off the phone feeling empowered. I thank you again and hope to speak again soon. Thanks, Rose xx.",

      "Mary has been reading for me for well over a decade. Her steady succinct advice is really remarkable. I make notes during readings so I can check discussions years later. There's a consistency with Mary which is confirmed over and over again. This is a serious person with highly developed clairvoyant abilities.",

      "Fran has read for me for a number of years and I like her style. She's a sincere reader, tells you how it is, won't make things fit and open to sharing her psychic knowledge. She's got answers to every question and I see her as a psychic mentor. She has brought through people from the spirit world and I've been grateful to hear from them. She's been very thorough with past events, spot on with the present and made some interesting insights for the future. I wouldn't choose any other reader. I like her a lot.",
